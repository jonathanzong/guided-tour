Have you ever wondered how Iphone Cases are made? Gears? Lamp shades? We engage with the utility of these objects everyday but do you ever question how they’re made? Have you ever wanted to make your own? Look before you and say hello to the machine that makes the manufacturing of all of these items possible. This is Boss Laser 3000, but you can call it Boss Laser for short. Now that you have met, I’m going to let Boss Laser speak to you about your mission for today.

<strong>Boss Laser</strong>: Hello Quantitatives. I hope you like my groutfit today. Ha. Ha. Moving along now. As a laser cutter, I operate through using optics and a high powered laser to cut through the materials you feed me. The combination of laser optics and a motion control system allow me to read and interpret the design you’ve generated with AutoCad software. I will interpret every line you make in your pattern into something called G-code, which allows me to understand how and where I should be cutting. 
</p>
<p>
Now that we’re acquainted, I can provide you with information on your next mission. You will visit another station later on, where a puzzling man will ask you to pull out a Tangram set. Now, since I highly doubt any of you will randomly have a set on you, I shall help you make one. I’ve had Rita, my secretary, prepare the file for you so all you have to do is execute the file! Rita can help you with any questions you have in the meantime. Each of you will leave with a Tangram set ready to complete the successive missions. 
</p>
