Welcome to the Studiolab gallery. Here we have on display work by students that happened in the Studiolab or relates to the mission of the lab.
</p>
<p>
The medium for these works includes everything from physical construction materials, electronics, and algorithms.

<strong>Drew Wallace ‘17</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Leap Motion Controller is a hand tracking device designed to let humans "interact with digital content... just as you would in the real world". 
</p>
<p>
A Show of Hands is a series of vignettes that illuminate and explore the Leap's failings in this goal. The physical-virtual divide needs not be overcome, but understood and embraced. The hands' mock-physical touches are playful and joyous - not in spite of their conspicuous unreality, but because of it. 
</p>

<strong>Helen Lin, Kathleen Ma, Mariah Wilson ‘18</strong>
</p>
<p>
Mother Womb is a full-sensory experience while evoking imagined memories and escaping reality. A portable tent envelops the viewer with visual, auditory and tactile sensations.
</p>
<p>
"This was a literal transformation of synthetic materials used for the 'womb' to create a natural environment," said Lin. "As a visual artist, I don't normally work with physical things. So I learned a lot by working on this physical environment, figuring out what works and what doesn't."

∆: light sound motion
</p>
<p>
A wave is energy that travels through space, oscillates over time.
</p>
<p>
Sound and light are characterized by the frequency and amplitude of their constituent waves. 
</p>
<p>
Pitch is analogous to color; they are both described by frequency.<br/>
Volume is analogous to intensity; they are both described by amplitude.<br/>
Δ is a light harmonograph that examines the dimensionality of these wave features. <br/>
</p>
<p>
In particular, how light and sound act in motion through space and time — how they are perceived in the interstices of change along these dimensions.
