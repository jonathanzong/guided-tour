<p>
The lighting setup you see before you is a state of the art system designed for use in theatrical productions. Newer models like this one use LED lights, which produce different colors and are less prone to overheating. Even in art forms like theatre with long histories, the technology that enables lighting designers work with constantly develops.
</p>
<p>
Take turns with the people around you to pick up the wand and point it at the lights around you. Think about how magical experiences like these can be mediated by technology, but in a way that the way it works takes a back seat to the way it feels. Hopefully the STUDIOLAB test initiative has allowed you to see how art and science relate to each other in a new light.
